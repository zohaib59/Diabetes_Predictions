# Diabetes_Predictions
Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning and Streamlit
A complete end-to-end machine learning project that predicts whether a person is diabetic or not using real-world data. 
This project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, deployment using Streamlit, and even Docker support.
Built a complete ML app that detects **Diabetes** using just a few clicks.
From data cleaning to model training, evaluation & live prediction – All done in one go!
